## ðŸ“Œ Details

- Using FakeStore API I've fetched the ecommerce items data using React Query
- Using React TypeScript I've succeeded in defining the Types of the data that has to be returned as a Promise and display in the UI
- For styling I've used MaterialUI components and icons & Styled Components for some special customising when MaterialUI wasn't enough
